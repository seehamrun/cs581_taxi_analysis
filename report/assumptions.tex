\section{Assumptions \& Restrictions}
\label{sec:assumptions}
The introduced methodology involves several assumptions and restrictions which allows a focus on the data handling and algorithmic components of the problem.  First, as previously mentioned, the solution strictly handles trips going to or from the LaGuardia Airport. 
To apply the algorithm in our data, we set the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All pick ups and drop offs within a one mile radius of the airports coordinates will be considered airport trips.  
\item Trips that have an exceptionally long distance or have a distance of zero, are  removed from the dataset.
\item We  filter out trips that have more than one passenger.   On the dimension of total passengers, every trip can be merged with every other trip.
\item  The passenger is not expected to walk any significant distance to reach their pick up or drop off location.
\item The social preferences of the passengers (non-smoking, similar interests, etc) are also not considered.  
\item Traffic is not considered- the travel time is assumed to be constant.  
\end{enumerate}
