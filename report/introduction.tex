\section{Introduction}

Handling ride share requests in a timely and efficient manner is a crucial  aspect of companies like Uber~\cite{uber} and Lyft.  
A critical component of handling ride share requests is the ability to merge trips based on nearby pickup or drop-off locations, rider preferences and delay tolerances.
This project presents one possible solution to this challenge.  

The following trial utilizes data from the records of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commision and isolates trips going to or from LaGuardia Airport. 
While certain assumptions and restrictions are conceded, this implementation presents significant and timely savings and could reasonably form the basis of a more complex merging mechanism in a real life environment.
